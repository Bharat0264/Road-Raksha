## 🎯 How the App Works

1. **User signs up** with name, email, mobile, city, state → stored in MongoDB
2. **User logs in** → JWT token issued, stored in localStorage
3. **User reports damage** → uploads photo + GPS location → sent to backend
4. **AI Analysis** → Anthropic Claude analyzes if image shows road damage
5. **If valid** → Report saved → Authority emailed → User confirmation emailed → Points awarded
6. **If invalid** → Report rejected with reason shown to user
7. **Ticket tracking** → User sees status timeline like an order tracker
8. **Map** → All active reports shown on Leaflet map with color-coded severity
9. **Points & Badges** → Earned automatically on valid report submission

| `assigned` | Team Assigned | Repair crew allocated |
| `work_in_progress` | Repair Underway | Active work happening |
